			<h1>About</h1>
			<br> Generally, there are two types of hospitals, private
			hospitals and government hospitals. An individual or group of
			physicians or organization run private hospitals. On the other hand,
			the government runs the government hospital. There are also
			semi-government hospitals that a private and organization and
			government-run together. Further, there are general hospitals that
			deal with different kinds of healthcare but with a limited capacity.

			General hospitals treat patients from any type of disease belonging
			to any sex or age. Alternatively, there are specialized hospitals
			that limit their services to a particular health condition like
			oncology, maternity and more. The main aim of hospitals is to offer
			maximum health services and ensure care and cure. Further, there are
			other hospitals also which serve as training centres for the upcoming
			physicians and offer training to professionals. Many hospitals also
			conduct research works for people. The essential services which are
			available in a hospital include emergency and casualty services, OPD
			services, IPD services, and operation theatre. Hospitals are very
			important for us as they offer extensive treatment to all. Moreover,
			they are equipped with medical equipment which helps in the diagnosis
			and treatment of many types of diseases. Further, one of the most
			important functions of hospitals is that they offer multiple
			healthcare professionals. It is filled with a host of doctors, nurses
			and interns. When a patient goes to a hospital, many doctors do a
			routine check-up to ensure maximum care. Similarly, when there are
			multiple doctors in one place, you can take as many opinions as you
			want. Further, you will never be left unattended with the
			availability of such professionals. It also offers everything under
			one roof. For instance, in the absence of hospitals, we would have to
			go to different places to look for specialist doctors in their
			respective clinics. This would have just increased the hassle and
			waste energy and time. But, hospitals narrow down this search to a
			great level. Hospitals are also a great source of employment for a
			large section of society. Apart from the hospital staff, there are
			maintenance crew, equipment handlers and more. In addition, they also
			provide cheaper healthcare as they offer treatment options for
			patients from underprivileged communities. We also use them to raise
			awareness regarding different prevention and vaccination drives.
			Finally, they also offer specialized treatment for a particular
			illness.
